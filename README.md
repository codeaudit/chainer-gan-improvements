# Improving Techniques for Training GANs

Chainer implementation of some of the techniques presented in the paper Improved Techniques for Training GANs [https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498) on the MNIST dataset.

## Minibatch Discrimination

Comparison of random samples created by generators with and without minibatch discrimination. The generators were trained for 100 epochs with 60000 images.
